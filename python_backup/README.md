# Python Code Backup

This directory contains the original Python implementation of the edge-deepstream application for backup and testing purposes.

## Files Backed Up
- main.py - Main application entry point
- utils/ - All utility modules
- test/ - Test scripts and validation code

## Purpose
- Preserve original Python implementation
- Enable comparison testing between Python and C++ versions
- Provide reference for logic verification during conversion

## Usage for Testing
You can run the original Python version from this backup to compare results with the new C++ implementation.

```bash
# Run original Python version
cd python_backup
python main.py <config_file>
```

## Conversion Notes
The C++ version maintains the same logic and functionality as this Python implementation.
